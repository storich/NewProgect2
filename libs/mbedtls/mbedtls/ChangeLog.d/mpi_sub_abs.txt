   * Fix a buffer overflow in mbedtls_mpi_sub_abs() when calculating
     |A| - |B| where |B| is larger than |A| and has more limbs (so the
     function should return MBEDTLS_ERR_MPI_NEGATIVE_VALUE). Only
     applications calling mbedtls_mpi_sub_abs() directly are affected:
     all calls inside the library were safe since this function is
     only called with |A| >= |B|. Reported by Guido Vranken in #4042.
